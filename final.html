        At a price of $38 this product is slightly more high end, however, a rating of 5 stars from 1448 buyers does not lie!
        The moisturiser is lightweight yet deeply hydrating so it is perfect for oily and acne prone skin which is often left oily and greasy by more heavy mositurisers. The recent surge and popularity of acids as gentle chemical exfoliants is well deserved. The addition of hyaluronic and polyglutamic acid to the formulation not only helps get rid of the dirt and dead skin cells accumulated throughout the day but also acts as a powerful hydrating agent.
        The Daily Greens formulation also includes a special blend of phytonutrients that help purify the skin by reducing shine and clearing pores of dirt and impurities. The moisturizer also calms the skin which is a benefit for those with sensitive or acne prone skin types. The ingredient list also include some wonderful natural products such as moringa seed extract, moringa water, papaya extract, kale, cucumber, eucalyptus and willow herb.
